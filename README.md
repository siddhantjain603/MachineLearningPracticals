This is my practice repository of MAchine Learning. Here I will add different types of Machine Learning problems like Regression and Classification.
I will make some sample apps using Flask API to showcase the process. All the datasets and models are present in their respective directories.

I want to thank Krish Naik SIr for their guidance in this process.
